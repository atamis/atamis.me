It&amp;rsquo;s more convenient when it runs fast and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot cheaper on build minutes. It used to take nearly 4 minutes to run. Now it takes just 40 seconds. Why did it take so long in the first place, and how did I make it so much faster?</description></item><item><title>Netns socat Trick</title><link>/posts/2019/05/16/netns-socat-trick/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 11:57:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019/05/16/netns-socat-trick/</guid><description>I mostly use this blog for theories, ideas, and think-pieces. But I figure I&amp;rsquo;ll return to the roots of blogging, and take the opportunity to explain a solution to a technical problem I encountered.
The Problem I have a home lab server I built out old gaming PC. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything with its mediocre graphics card (so no exciting machine learning stuff). I&amp;rsquo;ve used it as a file server and a render box (blender&amp;rsquo;s CPU rendering only), but I&amp;rsquo;ve also used it as a VPN client.</description></item></channel></rss>
