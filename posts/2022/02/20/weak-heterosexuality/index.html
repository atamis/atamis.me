western society. For reasons that will become clear, let&rsquo;s refer to this as
Strong Heterosexuality and Strong Homosexuality.</p><p>For historical reasons, Strong Heterosexuality refers to a relationship
consisting of exactly one man and one woman. Some proponents of Strong
Heterosexuality include other descriptors like requiring it to be &ldquo;for the
purposes of procreation&rdquo;, but this is out of scope as this article only
considers the classification of relationships. Similarly proponents of Strong
Heterosexuality may require the participants to be cisgender but we will not be
considering that aspect of gender in this article.</p><p>Strong Heterosexuality&rsquo;s counterpoint, Strong Homosexuality, covers every other
relationship. For example, a relationship consisting of two men or two women
would be Strongly Homosexual, but relationships between a man and a nonbinary
person, or 2 non-binary people, would be considered Strong Homosexual.</p><p>But this reveals a weakness in the naming of Strong Heterosexuality and Strong
Homosexuality. The <code>hetero-</code> prefix indicates that the participants are
different where the <code>homo-</code> prefix indicates that participants are the same (in
terms of gender). But some relationships, such as the previously mentioned
relationship between a man and a non-binary person are considered Strongly
Homosexual despite consisting of people of two different genders.</p><h1 id=weak-heterosexuality>Weak Heterosexuality</h1><p>Suppose we define Weak Heterosexuality as relationships consisting of no
identical genders. Suppose $ G $ is the set of all genders. A Weakly
Heterosexual relationship a set of genders $ H $ such that $ H \subset G $ and
$ |H| = 2 $ and $ \forall g_1, g_2 \in H, g_1 \neq g_2 $. Note $ | G | \geq 3 $<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> so
$ H $ is always a proper subset and there is always an $ n \in G $ such that $ n
\ni H$.</p><p>Any relationship that is Strongly Heterosexual is also Weakly Heterosexual by
definition.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> However a relationship between a man and a non-binary person would
be Weakly Heterosexual because $ man \neq nonbinary$.</p><p>But non-binary is not really a gender but a classification of genders: $ NB
\subset G$. Unfortunately the definition of $ NB $ is multifaceted and hotly
debated so we cannot give a full specification. However we can at least assert
that $ man, woman \ni NB $</p><h1 id=weak-homosexuality>Weak Homosexuality</h1><p>It is easy to derive Weak Homosexuality from Weak Heterosexuality: A Weakly
Homosexual relationship is a set of genders $ Q $ such that $ Q \subset G$ and
$ |Q| = 2$ and $ \forall g_1, g_2 \in Q, g_1 = g_2$.</p><p>So any relationship consisting of two people with exactly the same gender is
Weakly Homosexual. Otherwise it is Weakly Heterosexual.</p><p>It is worth noting that this is not necessarily a common view: this author has
heard the claim that (paraphrasing) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m non-binary so all my relationships are
homosexual,&rdquo; but in fact they would only be Strongly Homosexual and would only
be Weakly Homosexual if they only dated people with the same non-binary gender.</p><h1 id=annex-polyamory>Annex: Polyamory</h1><p>The above definitions of Weak Heterosexuality and Homosexuality include the
requirement that the set of genders in the relationship have only two genders.
But this requirement is unnecessary. Polyamorous relationships consisting of
more than two people can still be examined under the framework of Weak
Heterosexuality and Homosexuality.</p><p>For example a lesbian polycule consisting only of women would be Weakly
Homosexual as all members have identical genders.</p><p>However if a non-binary person joined the same polycule, a different gender
would have been introduced and the polycule would be Weakly Heterosexual.</p><p>Polyamorous relationships cannot be Strongly Heterosexual and are always
Strongly Homosexual.</p><h1 id=annex-genderfluid>Annex: Genderfluid</h1><p>Some people identify as genderfluid and have dynamic genders. Suppose $ f(t) \in
G $ represents a person&rsquo;s gender for some time $ t $<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. If $ f(t) $ were in a
relationship with $ g \in G $ their relationship would be Weakly Homosexual $
\forall t, f(t) = g $ and Weakly Heterosexual for all other $ t $.</p><p>If $ f(t) $ is not defined for all $ t $ see Annex: Agender.</p><h1 id=annex-agender>Annex: Agender</h1><p>Some people identify as &ldquo;agender&rdquo; and do not have a gender. This could be
defined such that, if $ g $ is an agender person&rsquo;s gender, then $ g \ni G$. But
agender people do not have gender so they cannot have $ g $ such that $ g $ is
their gender.</p><p>Let us examine the definition of Weakly Heterosexuality more carefully. Weak
Heterosexuality implicitly assumes that a relationship is a set $ R \subseteq P
$ where $ P $ is the set of all people. Thus $ H = \lbrace \forall p \in P :
gender(p) \rbrace $. However $ gender(p) $ is undefined for agender people and
if a relationship involves an agender person then $ |H| &lt; 2 $. The definition of
Weak Heterosexuality is undefined when $ |H| &lt; 2$ so relationships consisting of
one person with a gender and one agender person are neither Weakly Heterosexual
nor Weakly Homosexual.</p><p>Polyamorous relationships could involve three people with gender and any number of
agender people and the sexuality of the relationship would be defined by the
genders of the three people with gender and the agender people would not
contribute to the definition of sexuality of the relationship.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/13/joe-biden-three-genders-turning-point-usa/>https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/13/joe-biden-three-genders-turning-point-usa/</a> <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>You&rsquo;ll have to forgive this author for not giving a formal definition of
Strong Heterosexuality. Its proponents (which do not include this author)
are disinclined to encourage thought in this direction and give only
informal definitions. In fact one might be lead to think, based on the
definition of Strong Homosexuality, that Strong Heterosexuality was not
created for its own merit but perhaps as a method of establishing an
in-group and out-group. <a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3 role=doc-endnote><p>This is not to imply that all genderfluid people change gender in response
to changes in time: merely that their gender is defined for all $ t $. <a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></main><hr><section><a class=tag href=/tags/writing>writing</a></section><footer><div class="pride-strip pride-strip-position"></div><hr>Â© <a href=http://atamis.me>Azrea Amis</a> &mdash; <a href=http://github.com/atamis>Github</a> &mdash; 2022</footer></body></html>
