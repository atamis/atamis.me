# Azrea Amis


Hello, I'm a professional programmer specializing in backend development and
infrastructure. I use she/her pronouns. I've been programming since I was 9.
I've worked on a wide variety of languages and projects, including web
applications, cloud infrastructure, games, programming languages, and more.
These days I do a lot of functional programming in Clojure and a lot of
container based deployments. I also dabble in Rust for side projects.

You can find my code on my [github](http://github.com/atamis). My
