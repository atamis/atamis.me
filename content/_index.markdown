# Azrea Amis

Hello, I'm a programmer who specializes in server side programming and DevOps tasks.
I first started programming at age 9. Since then, I've become a polyglot
programmer with experience in a wide swatch of different languages,
technologies, and contexts. My vocational focus has been web application
development and deployment, but my coursework and personal projects have covered
graphics, game design, machine learning, system/linux,
programming language development, data structures, and algorithms.

You can find my code on my [github](http://github.com/atamis), my
