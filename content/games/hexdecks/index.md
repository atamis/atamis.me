This is a deck-based turn-taking puzzle-combat game. Reminiscent of Hoplite, it
puts the players in the shoes of a warrior making his way through an
increasingly blighted landscape. From the idyllic forest of "Faerie
Forest" to hellish "Subsea Volcano" to the ominous "Decrepit Crypt", reach the
level ending warpgate through the twin dangers of things trying to kill you and
a brutal action economy.

Click to move or click to attack, but neither you nor your opponents can do both
at once, so make sure you aren't in range of an enemy when you end your turn.
Assisting you in combat is a deck of cards allowing you to do more than just
move and attack. "Disengage" will let you attack and move back at the same time,
offering a solution to the thorny "two enemies in a row" problem, while "Jump"
lets you jump over obstacles and take another action before your enemies. Every
time you play a card, you draw a card, keeping your hand full of potential.

Created by Dan Marsh, Nick Care, Andrew Amis, Robert Tomcik, and Dan Karcher.

Can you beat the game without taking damage? We couldn't.
