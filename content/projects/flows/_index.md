In support of a colleague's data analysis, I built a live online data flow
application in Elixir to ingest large quantities (100s of gigabytes) of social
media data, process and filter the data, and load the data into a separate
database for directy querying. We utilized an iterative, agile methodology to
development the data processing and filtering techniques. I utilized Elixir for
its easy parallelism and functional nature.
